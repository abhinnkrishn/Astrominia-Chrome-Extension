Unfortunately I don't have a Chrome Developers Account, if I have had, it would be very easy for any one to Install. 
Let's see how to Install the Extension in your Browser Manually.

1) Step 1: Download the repository, a .zip file will be downloaded, extact the zip file.
2) Step 2: Open your Browser, type <strong>chrome://extensions</strong> in case of Chrome or <strong>edge://extensions</strong> in case of Edge and hit enter.
3) Step 3: When you enter that settings page you will see a Developer Mode Toggler(Top-right in Chrome and Bottom-left n Edge), toggle it on.
   You will see a <strong>Load Unpacked</strong> tab on the top.
4) Step 4: Click on <strong>Load Unpacked</strong> and select the Folder directory where you have unzipped the downloaded folder.

<h2> Voil√†! Your Extension has been installed Manually by you.</h2>
